description: "This self-paced tutorial explain how to work with tabular (.csv) 
time series data in R.  The data set used consists of micro-meteorology data 
collected at the NEON Harvard Forest field site and focuses on understanding 
annual patterns and phenology, however, the data skills cover are applicable to
all types of tabular data.  The tutorial consists of six sequential lessons, an
auxiliary lesson, and a culminating activity."

 <a href = "http://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> is a programming language
 that specializes in statistical computing. It is a powerful tool for
 exploratory data analysis. To interact with R, we strongly recommend 
<a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, an interactive development 
environment (IDE). 


###Install R Packages
You can chose to install packages with each lesson or you can download all 
of the necessary R Packages now. 

* **ggplot2:** `install.packages("ggplot2")`
* **ggthemes:** `install.packages("ggthemes")`
* **scales:** `install.packages("scales")`
* **gridExtra:** `install.packages("gridExtra")`
* **grid:** `install.packages("grid")`
* **reshape2:** `install.packages("reshape2")`
* **dplyr:** `install.packages("dplyr")`
